# For MySelf

## What is the PWA?
"A progressive web app (PWA) is an app that's built using web platform technologies, but that provides a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.

Like a website, a PWA can run on multiple platforms and devices from a single codebase. Like a platform-specific app, it can be installed on the device, can operate while offline and in the background, and can integrate with the device and with other installed apps."

## The difference between a PWA and a traditional website
"While traditional web apps operate within a browser, PWAs can provide a more native-like experience, closely resembling native mobile apps. PWAs can be installed on a device's home screen, run in a standalone window, and even access certain device features, such as push notifications and geolocation."

## The technologies needed to develop a PWA
"PWAs are built by front-end web developers with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. That is, there is no need to hire both Android and iOS mobile developers.
in addition : built using common web technologies including as i mentioned (HTML, CSS, JS) and WebAssembly as well"
